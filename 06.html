    <h1>Wednesday</h1>
    <p>Wednesday is an American coming-of-age supernatural comedy horror television series based on the character Wednesday Addams by Charles Addams.
        Created by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, it stars Jenna Ortega as the titular character, with Gwendoline Christie, Riki Lindhome, Jamie McShane, Hunter Doohan, Percy Hynes White, Emma Myers, Joy Sunday, Georgie Farmer, Naomi J. Ogawa, Christina Ricci, and Moosa Mostafa appearing in supporting roles. 
        Four out of the eight episodes are directed by Tim Burton, who also serves as executive producer. It revolves around Wednesday Addams, who attempts to solve a monster mystery at her new school.</p>
    <p>Burton was previously approached to direct the 1991 film and was involved with a cancelled stop-motion animated The Addams Family film.
        In October 2020, he was reported to be helming a television series, which was later given a series order by Netflix. 
        Ortega was cast in part to represent the character's Latina heritage.
        Ricci, who had played the titular character in the 1991 film and its 1993 sequel, was asked by Burton to join the series in a supporting role.
        Filming took place in Romania between September 2021 and March 2022.</p>
